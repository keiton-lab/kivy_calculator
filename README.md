## This is my first project, so I decided to start with building something small and useful.
### UPDATE: Working on package all files into a complete app which can be downloaded on iOS, Android, Mac, and PC. 

The main objective of the project was for me to learn the design structure of the Kivy library
<br />
<br />
To design the calculator frame, Kivy GUI used a separated file type (.kv) to separate the design portion and the coding/logic portion. 

* The design framework file: calculatorlayout.kv
* The calculator logic file: calculatorapp.py

<br />

**HOW TO USE**
<br />
<br />
You only need these two files to make it works:
<br />
* calculatorlayout.kv
* calculatorapp.py
<br />
Run " python calculatorapp.py "
