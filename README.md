## This is my first project, so I decided to start with building something small and useful.

The main objective of the project was for me to learn the design structure of the Kivy library
<br />
<br />
To design the calculator frame, Kivy GUI used a separated file type (.kv) to separate the design portion and the coding/logic portion. 

* The design framework file: calculatorlayout.kv
* The calculator logic file: calculatorapp.py
